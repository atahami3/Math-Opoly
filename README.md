Description: The project title is Mathopoly. This application uses Python and Pygame to create a math board game that combines the elements
of math and monopoly. The intented user base is elementary level students and their parents. Players will roll a dice to move around the board and land
on property squares. Each time a player rolls, they will be prompted with a math question they have to answer. Players can only purchase properties they
land on if they answer the math question correct. The game ends when one of the players buys three properties and then that player will be announced as the
winner. Once a winner is announced, users will be able to restart the game and play another round.

Objective: The purpose of Mathopoly is to help children practice their math skills in a fun and interactive way.
